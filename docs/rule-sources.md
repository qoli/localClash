# Rule Sources

Rule source files are adapter inputs, not pack catalogs.

Each file under `rule-sources/` should stay minimal:

```json
{
  "id": "sukkaw",
  "adapter": "sukkaw",
  "url": "https://github.com/SukkaW/Surge",
  "base_url": "https://ruleset.skk.moe"
}
```

The adapter owns source-specific transformation. It discovers or derives packs
and writes a runtime cache under `.runtime/rules/packs/`.

User selection belongs in a separate packs selection gob:

```json
{
  "proxy_groups": {
    "HK": {
      "nodes": ["🇭🇰香港01 | HK", "🇭🇰香港02 | HK"],
      "manual": true,
      "direct": false
    }
  },
  "policy_groups": {
    "Steam": {
      "exits": ["HK", "DIRECT"],
      "manual": true
    }
  },
  "enabled_packs": [
    {
      "source": "blackmatrix7",
      "pack": "Steam",
      "target": "Steam"
    }
  ]
}
```

`proxy_groups` materialize to Clash/Mihomo runtime proxy-groups. `nodes` must
be exact proxy names from `subscription.gob`; use `subscription_nodes_search`
to find candidate names first. Most groups do not verify egress regions with IP
lookup or hostname geolocation. The built-in `openai.chatgpt.mobile.v1`
capability is the exception: `subscriptions_refresh` derives its nodes by
requiring the expected root IP fingerprint (`HTTP 403`, `type: dc`, and
`cf_details` containing `Request is not allowed`) from both ChatGPT iOS and
Android endpoints through an isolated temporary Mihomo. The expected 403 is
positive evidence. Explicit ISP or region rejection is definitive, while a
connection reset, timeout, or unexpected response uses bounded retries and
failure hysteresis. A `capability` group cannot also declare `nodes` or `match`. Choose either
`auto: true` or `manual: true`; enabling both is rejected because it would
create competing runtime groups for the same target.

`policy_groups` are the optional business layer for ACL4SSR-style UX. Rules and
packs can target a visible group such as `Steam`; that group then offers exits
such as `HK`, `JP`, `⚡ 自动选择`, or `DIRECT` in Dashboard. Non-built-in exits must
refer to `proxy_groups`; policy groups do not directly select subscription
nodes.

The CLI surface is intentionally small:

```bash
go run . rules adapt
go run . rules index-dump --format json
go run . rules render --selection localclash-packs.gob
```

`rules adapt` reads source JSON and writes runtime pack cache plus
`.runtime/rules/packs/index.gob`. `rules index-dump` exposes that runtime index
for inspection. `rules render` reads the cache plus the selection gob and
renders rule-provider, proxy-group, and rule fragments only. It does not modify
`.runtime/mihomo/config.yaml`.
